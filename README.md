# My-Crackmes.one-solutions
I reverse engineer crackmes from this website.
Here is where I will upload my solutions / keygens to each challenge that I crack and include a link to it.

This repository is organized by separating each challenge into their respective folders.
Typically, each folder will have:
1. A makefile to compile and run my solution (compatible with Windows, Mac and Linux given that you have cmake / gnu installed).
2. The source code file to my solution along with a written explanation as to how I cracked the challenge.
3. For convenience, a .exe file of the original challenge that I used to crack.

Here is the link to the website:
